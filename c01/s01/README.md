Solutions
=========

This is the solutions/commentaries to problems on section 1.1.

Problem 1
---------

The proportion of heads minus 0.5 approaches 0 as n increases, but the number
of heads minus half the number of heads plus tails does not approach 0.  Weird...

Problem 2
---------

We need about 67 tosses so that the proportion of heads lies within 0.1 of
0.5 (i.e., between 0.4 and 0.6) in 95 out of 100 experiments.

Problem 3
---------

Running a simulation with 100,000,000 rolls of 3 dice it is possible to see
that the gamblers were correct, because 10 (0.125) came up more often than
9 (0.116).

Problem 4
---------

Running a simulation of 10,000 games, the proportion of games won is
approximately 0.82.
