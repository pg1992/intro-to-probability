Introduction to Probability
===========================

Solutions to the proposed problems in the book
[Introduction to Probability](https://chance.dartmouth.edu/teaching_aids/books_articles/probability_book/book.html)
by Grinstead and Snell.

Overview
--------

Each solution is written in Python using NumPy when convenient.

The solutions are all under a specific folder emulating the
book structure, but the solution _per se_ can be inside a
module together with other solutions of related problems
or it could be in a module by itself.

The module names are related to the subject of the question,
e.g. question 3 of section 1.1 is about a question that
gamblers asked Galileo in 1600's, so the name of the module
is Galielo.py.

Motivation
----------

The book is all about probability and its fascinating history.
Almost all questions in the book deals mostly with random simulations,
so it is natural to implement those simulations in a computer.
And, of course, it is a great learning experiment.

Now, about the choice of programming language. A natural choice
for me would be MATLAB since I am used to it, but Python contains all features
of a great language and on top of that there are great Python
modules that are very interesting to use like TensorFlow, NumPy, Scikit,
PyLab, etc.
